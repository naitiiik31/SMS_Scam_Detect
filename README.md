# 📱 SMS Scam Detection Project

## 📌 Overview
The SMS Scam Detection Project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify whether an SMS message is **Scam (Spam)** or **Legitimate (Ham)**.  
The system analyzes historical SMS data, processes textual patterns, and predicts message authenticity using a trained classification model.  
This project helps users avoid phishing attempts, fraudulent messages, and unwanted spam by providing real-time message classification.
